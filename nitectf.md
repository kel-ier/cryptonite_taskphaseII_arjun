# Cybernotes

## How I approached the challenge:

First went through the website and the login page
looked through the script and the different files to find anything related to the username or the password 
opened the website on burpsuite to and passed the request for the username and the password to the repeater, there I tried changing some of the attributes and the values to find different responses 


# Print the gifts
Began the program and tried the various types of format string attacks to try and receive different outputs
When passing %s, I received part of the next prompt which and so I tried different configurations to try and receive more outputs

# Backtrack 

I began by looking into the way documents are created related to delays in the japan railway system, and started looking 
for different certificates between the two station.
For 2017, the most relevant article was that a train left 20 seconds early, 
and I thought the train might have left early which led to him missing his train and then waiting for an hour for the next train but this 
was not between the two relevant stations.
